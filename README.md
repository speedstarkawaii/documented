# sec (script environment checker) #

this **project** is aimed for roblox script executors targetting any exploits environment. these include but are not limited to your functions, which give scripts access to run and function properly. 

**these are BASIC** functions, your exploit must support them in order to actually pass the test.

⚠️ ANY EXPLOIT CAN RUN THIS. THERE IS NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT CAN AND WHAT CANT RUN.
